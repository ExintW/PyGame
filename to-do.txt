add stamina for players
add stamina cost for attacks, moves and abilities

or maybe no stamina and each round players can only use attack or abilities or move Once

(Done) Ability: "Charge" for warriors
    - next move + 1 mobility
    - next atk + 1 dmg
(Done) Need to add buff and debuff attribute for players
    - categorize as atk, boost, def, etc.
    - when attacking, check atk buff list and target's def buff list
    - when moving or using abilities, check boost buff list
        -> Currently when a player has boost buff/debuff, next move will use all buff/debuff regardless of
            whether a player actually used that boost to move more/less distance.
            to use boost buff: player need to enter extra distance when using MOV (e.g. mov -2)

(Done) Ability: "Precision" for Archers:
    - attack range + 1 for 2 rounds

Need to detect duplicate buffs and add them together
    - e.g. 'Charge: atk+1', 'Charge: atk+1' => 'Charge: atk+2'

(Done) Need to organize files
    - mechanics folder: ability_types.py, abilities.py, buffs.py
    - game_stat folder: game_stats.py, prompt.py, UI_utils.py
    - player folder: player.py, player_class.py
    - globals folder: globals.py, colors.py
